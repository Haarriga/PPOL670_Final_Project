# Data Analysis Project
The objective of this project is to demonstrate an analysis relevant to 
governance, policy, or social sciences using the tools learned in this course. 
Our problem is [insert];
the data sets we find are Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement. It provides the usual monthly labor force data, but in addition, provides supplemental data on work experience, income, non-cash benefits, and migration. Comprehensive work experience information is given on the employment status, occupation, and industry of persons 15 years old and over.
the tools we choose to meaningfully inform the policy debate around the issue are supervised machine learning.

# Methods (choose one or more)
## Accessing data through web APIs

## Simulation modeling

## Geospatial analysis

## Supervised machine learning
We aim to use individuals' social and economic characteristics (e.g. gender, age, education, race, social assistance, SNAP benefits, etc.) to predict individuals' employment status. The employment status - A_EXPLP is our target variable, which is a categorical variable with 3 values (0,1,2). 

## Unsupervised machine learning

## Data imputation

## Cloud computing
